Learn graphics programming by building a production-grade engine.

</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why this exists?
Most graphics programming resources either:
- ⁉️ Teach basics without production context
- 📈 Show production code without explaining why
- 🏗️ Skip the journey from prototype to production

## What we're building?
A graphics engine that shows:
- 🚀 How to start simple and scale up
- 📊 Real production decisions as they happen
- 💡 Why we choose certain approaches over others

## Who it is for?
- 🔧 Anyone switching from tutorials into real projects
- 💻 Fresh developers wanting production experience
- 📚 Students ready for real-world practices

## How it works?
1. Start with working prototypes
2. Improve through real-world patterns
3. Document decisions as we make them
4. Show performance impacts
