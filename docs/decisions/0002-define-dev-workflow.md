# 2. Development Workflow and Process Standards
## Date
**2024-01-17**

## Status
**Accepted**

## Context
As a project serving both educational and production purposes, we need:
- Clear contribution guidelines
- Quality control mechanisms
- Learning-friendly processes
- Industry-standard practices

Current challenges:
- New contributors need clear guidance
- Quality must be maintained
- Learning curve must be manageable
- Changes must be traceable

## Decision
Implement a structured development workflow:

1. Branch Strategy
    - main: Production-ready code
    - development: Integration branch
    - feature/*: Feature development
    - bugfix/*: Bug fixes

2. Process Flow
    - Issue creation (bug/feature)
    - Branch creation
    - Development + testing
    - PR submission
    - Review + iteration
    - Merge

3. Templates and Standards
    - Standardized PR template
    - Issue templates
    - Commit message format

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear path for contributions
- Quality control built-in
- Educational opportunity in process
- Industry-standard practices
- Traceable changes

### Negative
- Initial overhead for small changes
- Learning curve for new contributors
- Process maintenance required
- Potential for process fatigue

## Implementation Notes
1. Templates location: .github/
2. Process documentation: docs/process/
3. Automation through GitHub Actions (future)
