# 3. Compiler Selection and Support Strategy
## Date
**2025-02-25**

## Status
**Proposed**

## Context
As an educational graphics engine project targeting x86_64 architecture, we need to:
- Provide optimal performance on x86_64 platform
- Ensure accesibility for contributors with different environments
- Maintain educational value through glear, progressive implementation
- Support organic growth of the codebase

Current Challenges:
- Contributors may have limited access to specific platforms
- Need to balance optimization with portability
- Educational aspect requires clear, understandable progression
- Multiple compiler support adds complexity

## Decision
Implement a phased approach to compiler support

1. Initial Phase
    - Primary support for GCC
    - Basic CMake configuration
    - Portable code without specific optimizations
    - Clear documentation of environment requirements

2. Expansion Phase
    - Add support for Clang and MSVC
    - Introduce basic x86_64 optimizations
    - Implement corss-compiler testing
    - Document compiler-specific considerations

3. Optimization Phase
    - Integrate Intel OneAPI support
    - Implement advanced x86_64 optimizations
    - Maintain alternative code paths for other compilers
    - Performance benchmarking and documentation

## Consequences
### Positive
- Progressive learning path for contributors
- Reduced initial complexity
- Clear upgrade path
- Maintainable codebase
- Educational value in optimization process

### Negative
- Delayed optimization features
- Need for careful documentation
- Additional testing requirements
- Potential compiler-specific issues

## Implementation Notes
1. Initial Setup Requirements:
    - CMake 3.20 or higher
    - Primary compiler selection criteria documented
    - Basic build system structure established

2. Documentation Path:
    - /docs/setup/compiler-requirements.md
    - /docs/contributing/compiler-setup-guides
    - /docs/optimization/compiler-specific-guides

3. Future Considerations
    - CI/CD pipeline for cross-compiler testing
    - Performance benchmarking framework
    - Compiler-specific optimization guides
