## 1. Project Vision
### 1.1 Problem Statement
The field of graphics programming presents a significant educational challenge: while theoretical resources are abundant, practical implementation experiences are scarce. This leads to several key issues:

**State of art**:
- Learning graphics programming typically involves either:
  - Following tutorials that don't scale to production needs
  - Diving into complex engines without understanding core concepts
- Documentation often explains *what* but rarely *why* and *how*
- Real-world optimization techniques remain largely inaccessible to learners

**Core Problems**:
1. **Knowledge Gap**: Disconnect between theory and practical implementation
2. **Learning Isolation**: Students often learn in isolation without seeing real development practices
3. **Documentation Depth**: Most resources don't capture the decision-making process behind architectural choices
4. **Best Practices**: Limited exposure to production-grade development workflows

**Impact**:
- Aspiring graphics programmers struggle to transition from learning to professional development
- Educational resources rarely align with industry practices
- Students miss crucial insights about performance optimization and architecture decisions

**Target Outcome**: 
The Yashima Engine will serve as both a learning platform and a practical rendering engine by:
- Providing a self-documenting, educational codebase
- Implementing professional development practices with detailed explanations
- Capturing architectural decisions and their rationale
- Demonstrating optimization techniques with clear performance metrics
- Creating a bridge between learning and professional development

This approach transforms the traditional engine development process into an educational journey, documented and structured for future graphics programming enthusiasts.

### 1.3 Design Principles
The Yashima Engine's design principles are arranged in order of fundamental impact, following a hierarchical dependency model:

#### 1.3.1 Performance by Design
**Principle**: Performance considerations must be architectural, not afterthoughts.

**Justification**: Graphics performance is fundamentally tied to architectural decisions and cannot be effectively retrofitted.

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- All systems must specify performance budgets upfront
- Performance metrics must be measurable and monitored
- Critical paths must be identified and documented
- Memory access patterns must be explicitly designed
- Cache coherency must be considered in data structures

#### 1.3.2 Educational Transparency
**Principle**: Every technical decision must be traceable and comprehensible.

**Justification**: Understanding the 'why' behind technical decisions is crucial for both learning and maintenance.

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- All major decisions require documented Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Performance implications must be quantified and explained
- Alternative approaches must be documented with trade-off analysis
- Implementation patterns must include educational context
- Debugging and profiling tools must be learning-oriented

#### 1.3.3 Systematic Modularity
**Principle**: Components must be self-contained but transparently interconnected.

**Justification**: Modular design enables both learning isolation and system scalability.

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Clear interface boundaries between components
- Explicit dependency management
- Standardized communication patterns
- Documented component lifecycles
- Testable in isolation

#### 1.3.4 Automated Verification
**Principle**: All critical behaviors must be automatically verifiable.

**Justification**: Reliable learning requires consistent behavior validation.

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Comprehensive unit testing framework
- Automated performance benchmarking
- Visual regression testing
- Memory leak detection
- API consistency validation

#### 1.3.5 Progressive Complexity
**Principle**: Features must follow a clear complexity progression.

**Justification**: Learning is optimized when complexity increases gradually.

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Clear prerequisite chains
- Incremental feature implementation
- Documented complexity levels
- Optional advanced implementations
- Progressive optimization paths

#### 1.3.6 Platform Independence
**Principle**: Core concepts must be platform-agnostic.

**Justification**: Understanding should transcend specific APIs or hardware.

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Abstract interface design
- Platform-specific implementation isolation
- Consistent abstraction layers
- Documented platform differences
- Portable algorithms
